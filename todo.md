- Fix boundary condition application for velocity field to ensure not overwriting data cells
- Revise SIMPLEC algorithm to show debugging output
- Check boundary conditions for pressure field
- Check code for consistency with constant values usage -- ensure no hardcoded values wherever possible
- Check boundary condition application for walls (should be no-slip)
- Implement non-orthogonal correction for pressure gradient
